# Houston Recycling Map Project README


## Overview

This repo contains my work from the week 2 project from the
[Developing Data Products][1] class from Johns Hopkins University within the
[Data Science Specialization][2] on Coursera. The original instructions for the
project can be found beneath the brief description section below. The script,
markdown, and html files were created in RStudio.

## Brief Description

The original instructions for this assignment are shown below. We were free to
choose our own topic and data source, so I browsed public data on the
[City of Houston website][3] and settled on the recycling locations. There are
three main files in this repo: a script, an Rmd file, and the html report. The
project began with the script, where the core analysis was performed. Once
complete the script was reorganized into an Rmd file. The R markdown file was
knit into an html report which was the deliverable for the assignment.
