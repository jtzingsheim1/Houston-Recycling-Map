# Acknowledgement for this dataset goes to the City of Houston who make this
# data available through their GIS open data portal which is located at the
# URL: https://cohgis-mycity.opendata.arcgis.com/


# The purpose of this script is to complete the basic requirements behind the
# project 1 peer-graded assignment which is part of the Developing Data Products
# course from Johns Hopkins University within the Data Science Specialization on
# Coursera.
#
# The instructions say:
# "Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
# Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage
# must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map
# created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
#
# The input for this document is the COHGIS Recycling Center Locations dataset
# which comes from the URL below. The script leaves behind a data objects, but
# the primary purpose is completing the core of the project, so end deliverables
# can be easily created later.
