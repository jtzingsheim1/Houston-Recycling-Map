## Overview

This report is for the week 2 peer-graded project in the Developing Data
Products course from Johns Hopkins University within the Data Science
Specialization on Coursera. The instructions say to create a web page using R
Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

To meet the objective a map was created which shows recycling locations in the
area of Houston, TX. The input for this document is a static file of the COHGIS
Recycling Center Locations dataset which came from the URL below.
